# Microsoft_Movie_Analysis

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Microsoft is venturing into the film industry with the establishment of a new movie studio. However, lacking experience in movie production, Microsoft faces the challenge of determining which film genres to prioritize to ensure commercial success.

My project aims to address this issue by providing actionable insights to guide Microsoft's movie production strategy. Through analysis of industry trends and audience preferences, my project seeks to recommend strategic approaches that will enable Microsoft to effectively compete in the dynamic and competitive movie market.

### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

It is imperative to conduct a thorough market analysis of the filmindustry, encompassing major stakeholders and audience
preferences. This entails identifying successful film genres through box office performance analysis and examining the competitive strategies of existing movie studios.Aligning Microsoft's business goals with the objectives of its new movie studio venture and considering long-term implications will ensure an effective strategy.

### DATA UNDERSTANDING

I will be using the following datasets:

1. im.db.zip which contains tables such as "movie_basics" and "movie_ratings," which will offer insights into the basic
information and ratings of various movies.

2. bom.movie_gross.csv.gz file which will provide data on box office gross for different movies.

### GENERAL OBJECTIVES

Analyzing box office sales data to understand the popularity and profitability of different genres.
Identifying genres and content themes that have a high likelihood of commercial success.
Investigate the trends of different genres in the film industry over the years.
Translate research findings into actionable insights that Microsoft can use to make informed decisions.
